This was a very sudden change for not just myself - but for a lot of people in the free/libre software community. I do not wish to see the future of GitHub with Microsoft as the owner. Microsoft has only been known as a threat to the FOSS community with the infamous Embrace, Extend, Extinguish policy. Their ideals contrast that of my own and I can not remain on a platform owned by one of many megacorporations with low morals.

If anyone wants to view my repos or partner in future endeavors, you can find me on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/caton101).
